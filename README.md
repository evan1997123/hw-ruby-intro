Ruby Intro CI
=============

The single-source-of-truth repository for the ruby introduction homework of the Berkeley ESaaS course.

The separate student-facing repository (located at https://github.com/saasbook/hw-ruby-intro) is automatically generated based off the contents of this repo. A 'codio ready' version of this assignment has also been generated in the `codio` branch. Both versions are generated on each commit to this -ci repo.

Note this private repository also contains the solution and autograder.
